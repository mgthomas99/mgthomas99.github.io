# Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
### Requisites
- [Nearley](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nearley) -> A JavaScript parser generator compatible with NodeJS.

### Abstract
Given a string input, the program should lex and parse the string and generate a syntax tree representing
the input code.

### About
As part of a personal project, I would like to parse Lua code. I am doing this using Nearley, a JavaScript
tool for generating parsers using grammar files.
